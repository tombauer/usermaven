# Usermaven

## Description
Usermaven's web analytics product is a Google Analytics alternative that provides a real-time view of your website traffic metrics. Cookie-free, hosted in EU, and fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR. Usermaven helps marketing and product teams turn more visitors into customers, get more people to use the product, and keep them coming back. No more guessing or relying on intuition – let data drive your success.

## Why Usermaven?
Most firms try to use complex and expensive analytics platforms like Mixpanel or Amplitude but never get around to properly configuring them to get meaningful insights. You need a product analytics solution that’s easy to setup and has ready-made templates to generate actionable insights for making data-backed growth decisions. That’s why Usermaven was built, the new data scientist in your team.

## Installation
Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Usermaven, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New". In the search field type "Usermaven" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

## Tracking identified users
If a `$current_user` is present, and `Identify logged-in users in Useramven` option is enabled, then we will automatically identify your logged-in users.
